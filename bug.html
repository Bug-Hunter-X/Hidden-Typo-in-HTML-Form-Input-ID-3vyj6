<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML bug.  It involves a seemingly innocuous typo that can cause unexpected behavior. The following code snippet is designed to create a simple HTML form with two input fields and a button.</p><code> <form>   <label for="name">Name:</label>   <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>   <label for="email">Email:</label>   <input type="email" id="eamil" name="email"><br><br>   <input type="submit" value="Submit"> </form> </code><p>The bug lies in the 'id' attribute of the email input field. It is mistakenly written as "eamil" instead of "email". Although this might seem minor, it can lead to form submission issues or prevent JavaScript from properly accessing the email field value if you use the 'email' ID to select it.</p>
